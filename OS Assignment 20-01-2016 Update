In this update I will be showuing off a small piece of code that allows me to check if the current PC has dialog
installed already so it can use my program that uses dialog. If it does have dialog installed then it run my GUI.sh
file but if it doesn't have dialog installed then it will open up the traversal.sh and simply output the current 
directories information in the terminal. I will work more on this so the user has a choice of the directory they 
wish to view the information about. The code is:
yum -q list installed steam &>/dev/null && ./GUI.sh || ./traversal.sh
