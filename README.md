This is Daniel Naylor's repository for the 2nd assignment for Operating Systems in practice. This is for the MEng Computer Science Course at Leeds Beckett University by Daniel Naylor, 33431621.

My final code and documentation for the assignment is in the commit "Final code and documentation for David to mark for Assignment 2". Just so it's easier to find it if I point out the most up to date version as using github is still quite new to me. As mentioned in the commit, the four script files will need to be made executable before they can be executed within Linux. The four script files need to be in the same directory when executing but they can traverse so any directory which running.

I have some previous versions of commits where I first started using github and trying to understand how it works so they may not be the most appropriate names. But for the previous versions I have shown different techniques and ways I have tried to tackle this assignment by using DU and tryng to use Java to change the output and then scrapping that idea and going with traversal instead which is how I have managed to complete the assignment's needs. The four script files need to be named, GUI.sh, traversal.sh, basic.sh and main.sh as they all call each other and link up.
